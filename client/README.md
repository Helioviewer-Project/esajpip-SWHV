# client

A JPIP client for the JP2 images and JPX movies that esajpip serves. Given a
frame number and a resolution, it fetches what it does not have yet, decodes
the frame, and returns 8-bit pixels. It also gives each frame's XML metadata
and color table. Data received once is kept, so showing a frame again, or
smaller, makes no request.

| Part | Use it for | Start at |
| --- | --- | --- |
| JavaScript module | A web application | [JavaScript](#javascript) |
| C library | A native program that makes its own HTTP requests | [C](#c) |
| Demonstration page | Seeing it work against your server | [Quick start](#quick-start) |
| `hv_jpp2j2k` | Turning responses saved with curl into a `.j2k` file | [hv_jpp2j2k](#hv_jpp2j2k) |

The C library is the client. The JavaScript module is the same code built for
WebAssembly, with the HTTP exchange and a Web Worker around it.

## Quick start

With the project configured in `build`, the server running on its default
port, and a `movie.jpx` in its image directory
([`../README.md`](../README.md)):

```sh
cmake --build build --target esajpip_client_wasm
python3 -m http.server -d build/client/web 8000
```

Then open
<http://localhost:8000/?server=http://localhost:8900&image=movie.jpx>.

The first command needs [zig](https://ziglang.org/) (`brew install zig`): its
C compiler builds the WebAssembly module, and carries the C library OpenJPEG
needs. Without zig the target does not exist; the rest of the project builds
as usual. `build/client/web/` receives everything a page needs:
`esajpip_client.wasm`, `jpip_source.mjs`, `jpip_worker.mjs`,
`jpip_channel.mjs`, and the demonstration page as `index.html`.

On the page:

- The image opens at its lowest resolution. There is a button for each
  resolution, up to `Full size`.
- `Preview (1 layer)` requests one quality layer at the selected resolution.
  Switch to `Full quality` to fetch the remaining layers and redraw. The
  status line reports the quality actually cached, which may already be higher
  than the selection. The opening response has full quality at the lowest
  resolution.
- For a movie, the slider chooses the frame and Play steps through the frames,
  at most 10 a second. While a frame is on its way, only the last slider
  position is kept.
- The strip under the slider shows the cache: dark for frames ready at the
  selected resolution and quality, pale for frames with some cached data.
- "Fetch ahead" fetches the other frames at the selected resolution and quality,
  one at a time, starting after the current frame.
- "XML metadata" shows the XML of the current frame. The status line shows the
  bytes received so far.

The page is an example of the JavaScript module and nothing more. It draws on
a 2D canvas, so it converts the pixels to RGBA and applies the color table
itself.

## Terms

- **Frame.** A codestream of the file, numbered from 0. A JP2 has one. A JPX
  has one per image, whether the images are embedded or linked. The frames of
  one JPX may differ in size, components, resolution levels and color table,
  so each frame reports its own.
- **`reduce`.** The number of highest resolution levels left out, as in
  `opj_decompress -r` and `kdu_expand -reduce`. The size is the full size
  divided by 2^`reduce`, rounded up: a 4096x4096 frame is 1024x1024 at
  `reduce` 2. A value beyond what the frame has gives its lowest resolution.
- **Cached.** A resolution level of a frame is cached once all its data has
  arrived. A request brings only the levels that are not.
- **Channel.** The server's record of what one client has received for one
  image. The server ends a channel left idle for `connections.timeout`, 60
  seconds by default; see [Failures](#failures).

## JavaScript

### Setup

Put `jpip_source.mjs`, `jpip_worker.mjs`, `jpip_channel.mjs` and
`esajpip_client.wasm` in one directory of the site, and import
`jpip_source.mjs`. The page may be on another origin than the server, which
sends `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`.

### Showing a frame

```js
import { JpipSource } from "./jpip_source.mjs";

const source = await JpipSource.open({
    wasm: new URL("esajpip_client.wasm", import.meta.url),
    server: "http://localhost:8900",
    image: "movie.jpx" });               // a path below the image directory

const frame = await source.frame(3, { fit: [1024, 768] });

// One byte per pixel: rows are not padded to 4 bytes.
gl.pixelStorei(gl.UNPACK_ALIGNMENT, 1);
gl.texImage2D(gl.TEXTURE_2D, 0, gl.R8, frame.width, frame.height, 0,
              gl.RED, gl.UNSIGNED_BYTE, frame.pixels);

await source.close();
```

`frame` resolves to:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `index` | The frame number |
| `reduce` | The resolution reduction selected for this frame |
| `width`, `height` | The size of the decoded image |
| `components` | 1 or 3 |
| `pixels` | A `Uint8Array` of `width * height * components` bytes, top row first, components interleaved. It is a copy that belongs to the caller |
| `fullWidth`, `fullHeight` | The size at `reduce` 0 |
| `resolutions` | The number of resolution levels: `reduce` runs from 0 to `resolutions - 1` |
| `layers`, `totalLayers` | The minimum whole quality layers available across the decoded resolutions, and the source's total |
| `quality` | Whole quality layers available per resolution, lowest resolution first. A missing resolution has 0 |
| `complete` | All quality layers are present at the decoded resolution and every lower resolution |
| `ready` | The requested quality is cached at the selected resolution and every lower resolution. Always true after successful `frame` or `fetch` |

`{ fit: [width, height] }` gives the available display area in physical
pixels. The client fits the image into it, preserving aspect ratio, and
chooses the coarsest available resolution that covers the drawn image.
For example, a 4096x4096 image in a 1000x800 area needs an 800x800 image,
so the client decodes at 1024x1024 (`reduce` 2).

The application supplies its CSS display size multiplied by the device
pixel ratio. For zoom, supply the area the whole image would occupy,
including the part outside the viewport. Requests still fetch whole frames.

For explicit control, use `{ reduce: n }`: a nonnegative integer, or
`Infinity` for the lowest resolution. Omitting options gives full resolution.
`fit` and `reduce` cannot be combined. `source.frames` is the number of frames.

### API flow

```text
source = await JpipSource.open(...)
    |
    v
Choose frame index and display area in physical pixels <----+
    |                                                       |
    v                                                       |
frame = await source.frame(index, { fit: [width, height] }) |
    |                                                       |
    v                                                       |
Upload frame.pixels and draw at the desired display size    |
    |                                                       |
    v                                                       |
Finished with source? -- no: wait for next display change --+
    |
    yes
    |
    v
await source.close() when finished with the source
```

`fit` selects the decoding resolution. The application still scales and draws
the returned pixels at its desired display size. No geometry or cache query
is required before calling `frame`.

The client obtains the frame header if missing, chooses a resolution from
that frame's geometry, fetches missing levels, reconstructs the codestream,
and decodes it. This works independently for each frame, including movies
with different frame sizes. Cached levels need no request, but each `frame`
call decodes again.

Optionally, `await source.fetch(index, { fit: [width, height] })` fetches ahead
without decoding. A later `frame` call with the same options uses that cache.

### What the pixels are

| Frame | `components` | `pixels` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| One or two components, no color table | 1 | The first component as gray, scaled to 8 bits |
| Three or more components | 3 | The first three components as RGB, each scaled to 8 bits |
| With a color table | 1 | Indices into the table, unchanged |

Scaling keeps the 8 most significant bits of deeper samples, and shifts
shallower ones up. Signed samples are offset to unsigned first.

A frame with a color table is not converted to color. `palette` gives the
table, and the application applies it, typically as a lookup texture:

```js
const lut = await source.palette(3);     // null if the frame has none
if (lut !== null && lut.channels === 3)
    gl.texImage2D(gl.TEXTURE_2D, 0, gl.RGB8, lut.entries, 1, 0,
                  gl.RGB, gl.UNSIGNED_BYTE, lut.table);
```

- `table` is a `Uint8Array` of `entries * channels` bytes: for each index from
  0 to `entries - 1`, its `channels` values, scaled to 8 bits. `channels` is 3
  for red, green, blue. It is a copy that belongs to the caller.
- An index can be larger than `entries - 1` when the table has fewer than 256
  entries. The demonstration page uses the last entry for those.
- Indices are supported for a frame of one unsigned component of at most 8
  bits. Any other frame with a color table fails to decode.

The display API does not interpret `colr`, ICC profiles or channel definitions,
and does not convert color spaces such as sYCC to RGB. Three decoded components
are returned in their existing order and displayed as RGB. Use grayscale,
RGB, or supported palette images whose samples already have that meaning.
The server can accept files outside this display subset. The native
`hv_reconstruct` API preserves the codestream's sample precision and components;
a host using another decoder must handle the file's color interpretation itself.

### XML

```js
const xml = await source.xml(3);         // a string, or null
```

This is the XML that describes the frame; for a FITS image, its header. In a
JPX it is found as `hv_merge` and hvJP2K write it: the `xml` box of the
association box (`asoc`) whose number list (`nlst`) names the frame. In a JP2
it is the first top-level `xml` box.

The XML and the color tables of all frames arrive when the source is opened,
so `xml` and `palette` never make a request.

### Playing a movie

`frame` fetches what is missing before it decodes, so a movie played frame by
frame waits for the server at every new frame. `fetch` gets a frame's data
without decoding it:

```js
for (let index = 0; index < source.frames; index++)
    await source.fetch(index, { fit: [1024, 768] });
```

After that, `frame(index, { fit: [1024, 768] })` decodes from the cache.

- **One at a time.** `frame`, `fetch` and `close` run in the order they were
  called, one after the other. With one `fetch` pending, as in the loop above,
  a `frame` call made meanwhile waits for one request at most. A hundred
  `fetch` calls made at once would all run before it.
- **Progress.** `fetch` returns the frame's display status without `pixels`.
  `cached(index, options)` returns the same status without fetching or
  decoding, or `null` if the frame's header is missing. It does not wait for
  requests under way. `ready` says whether the supplied options are satisfied;
  `complete` says whether full quality is cached at the selected resolution.
- **Other resolutions.** A frame cached at `reduce` 1 also serves `reduce` 2
  and above. Fetching it at `reduce` 0 later brings the one missing level.
- **Decoding.** Every `frame` call decodes. Decoded frames are not kept: keep
  the textures of frames shown repeatedly.
- **First request for a frame.** If its main header has not arrived, a
  header-only request (`stream=index&layers=0`) obtains its size and resolution
  levels before requesting pixels. This adds one round trip on the first
  visit, and makes the request exact even when movie frames differ in size.

### Preview and refine

Add `layers` to either display option to request a lower-quality preview:

```js
const preview = await source.frame(index, { fit: [1024, 768], layers: 1 });
// Upload and display preview.pixels.

const refined = await source.frame(index, { fit: [1024, 768] });
// Replace the texture with refined.pixels.
```

`layers` is a positive safe integer, clamped to the frame's total. Omit it
for all layers. `fetch` accepts the same options, so a movie can be fetched
first with one layer, then refined. The application chooses when to refine
and redraw. Layer count is a quality step, not a percentage of final quality.

The client records whole packets only after the requested window ends
normally. Reconstruction writes those packets and empty packets for missing
layers. A later request adds data to the same bins. Asking for fewer layers
does not discard existing data or lower the quality of the returned frame.
Quality is tracked independently for each resolution, so previewing at a
larger size does not lose the finer quality already fetched at a smaller size.

This uses the server's existing `layers` support and ordinary JPP messages.
Byte-limited previews are not supported yet.

Prefetching also reports quality without decoding:

```js
const options = { fit: [1024, 768], layers: 1 };
const status = await source.fetch(index, options);
// status.ready is true; status.complete may still be false.

const cached = await source.cached(index, options);
if (cached?.ready) {
    const frame = await source.frame(index, options); // decode with no request
}
```

All three methods accept the same options. Status describes that selection:
changing the display size or requested layers can change `ready`. Omitting
options asks about full resolution and full quality.

### Several images

A source is one channel and one Web Worker: fetching and decoding run off the
page's thread, and sources do not wait for each other. Open one per image or
movie on screen. The module is downloaded and compiled once per page, whatever
the number of sources.

### Failures

A call that fails rejects its promise with an `Error` whose message says why.

| Failure | What happens | What to do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `index` is not a frame, or the display options are not valid | `RangeError`; no request is made | Fix the call |
| A transport interruption, or the server reports that the channel has ended or does not exist | Restore a replacement channel from the retained cache and retry the request once | No application action if recovery succeeds |
| Recovery fails, another HTTP error occurs, or JPP is malformed | The call rejects. Later calls needing a request reject with the same error; cache hits still succeed | Close the source and open the image again |
| "the server did not send frame N whole" | The call rejects; the source is unaffected. A response ended without the data asked for, which this server does not do | |
| A call after `close()` | Rejects with "the source is closed" | |

If loading or compiling the WASM module fails, a later `JpipSource.open` with
the same module URL tries again. A successfully compiled module is shared by
sources on the page.

An idle channel expires after `connections.timeout` (60 seconds by default).
The next request for uncached data restores it automatically. A server restart
is handled the same way. Metadata, prepared frame headers, preview quality
records and precinct data-bins remain in the client. Cache hits need no live channel.

Recovery opens the original target with no frame selected and declares retained
complete bins and exact partial byte prefixes in bounded `model` batches. It
never declares partial `M0`. Metadata repeated during restoration is checked
against the retained bytes. Normal responses still must append exactly to each
bin. Once restoration finishes, the interrupted request resumes; another failure
ends recovery. Closing a source prevents it from reopening a channel.

This relies on the server's immutable-source contract: the target and its linked
files must remain unchanged across channel replacement, including server restarts.
`JPIP-tid: 0` does not establish file identity. If the target changes, close the
source and open it again. Busy channels, invalid requests, missing targets, and
internal server errors are not retried.

### Memory

A source keeps every byte it receives until `close()`: the server does not
send data twice on a channel, and takes no note of a client that drops some. A
movie fetched whole at full size therefore takes about the size of its
codestreams, plus the tables that index them. Decoding adds, for its duration,
a copy of the frame's codestream and OpenJPEG's working memory. The module
keeps the last decoded image until the next decode; the page gets its own
copy. A frame's parsed geometry and prepared reconstruction header are also
kept once first used, until the source closes.

### Reference

| `JpipSource` | Result | Requests |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `JpipSource.open({ wasm, server, image })` | A source. `wasm` is the URL of the module, `server` the server's address, `image` a path below its image directory | 1 |
| `frames` | The number of frames | |
| `received` | Bytes of response bodies so far, as of the last `frame` or `fetch` | |
| `frame(index, options = {})` | The decoded frame. Options: `{ fit: [width, height] }` or `{ reduce: n }`, optionally with `layers` | For the resolution and quality levels not cached |
| `fetch(index, options = {})` | The frame's display status without `pixels`; same options as `frame` | For the resolution and quality levels not cached |
| `cached(index, options = {})` | Display status for those options, or `null` if the header is missing | 0 |
| `xml(index)` | A string, or `null` | 0 |
| `palette(index)` | `{ entries, channels, table }`, or `null` | 0 |
| `close()` | Closes the channel, frees the cache and ends the worker | 1 |

All but `frames` and `received` return promises.

The first request brings the metadata of all frames and the lowest resolution
of frame 0.

### Without a worker

`jpip_channel.mjs` exports `JpipChannel`, which is what the worker runs. Use
it directly where the code is already off the main thread, or under Node.js:

```js
import { JpipChannel } from "./jpip_channel.mjs";

const channel = await JpipChannel.open(wasm, server, image);
```

`wasm` is a compiled `WebAssembly.Module`, the module's bytes, or its URL. The
methods are those of `JpipSource`, except that `cached`, `xml` and `palette`
return their result directly, not a promise.

## C

`esajpip_client` is a static library; its headers are in `client/`. Inside
this build, `target_link_libraries(app PRIVATE esajpip_client)` is enough. The
library does no I/O: the program sends the requests and passes each response
body to the library.

### Source API

Use `hv_client.h` for one source. It owns the data-bin cache, metadata and
pending frame request. The same API drives the WebAssembly client.

```text
Create source
    ↓
Host opens channel and submits the initial response
    ↓
Read frame count, XML and palette
    ↓
Prepare frame with viewport fit or reduction, and quality
    ├─ HEADER → host requests stream=frame,layers=0
    ├─ FRAME  → host requests stream=frame,fsiz=width,height,closest,layers=k
    │               ↓
    │          Submit response, then prepare again
    └─ READY  → reconstruct codestream → host decodes and displays
    ↓
Host closes channel; destroy source
```

`hv_client_options` initialized to zero selects full resolution and quality.
Set both `fit_width` and `fit_height` to the physical viewport dimensions to
select a resolution for an aspect-ratio-preserving fit, or set `reduce` to
remove highest resolution levels. `INT_MAX` selects the lowest resolution.
Do not combine a fit with a nonzero reduction. `layers=0` means all source
layers; positive values are clamped to the frame's layer count.

`hv_client_status` inspects readiness without preparing a request.
`hv_client_prepare` also remembers the exact request to confirm after its
response. A missing header produces `HV_CLIENT_HEADER`; its geometry is zero.
Once the header is cached, `HV_CLIENT_FRAME` supplies exact dimensions and
`requested_layers`. `HV_CLIENT_READY` needs no request. `view.source` describes
the original components and geometry; `view.layers` is the minimum cached
quality across the selected resolution levels.

The host retains HTTP, channel routing, scheduling and decoding. Submit the
opening response with `hv_client_response`, then use `hv_client_frames` to
read the frame count. Keep one request outstanding per source, serialize all
calls, and do not add `len` or a region to prepared requests. After each
response, prepare again until the requested frame is ready. This handles
heterogeneous movies using each frame's own header. Successful completed
responses confirm whole-packet layer boundaries automatically.

```c
hv_client *source = hv_client_create();
if (source == NULL)
    return fail("out of memory");

/* The host supplies the initial response body. */
if (hv_client_response(source, body, body_size) < 0 || !hv_client_frames(source))
    goto failed;

hv_client_options options = {0};
options.fit_width = viewport_width;
options.fit_height = viewport_height;
options.layers = 1;
hv_client_view view;
for (;;) {
    if (hv_client_prepare(source, frame, &options, &view) != 0)
        goto failed;
    if (view.request == HV_CLIENT_READY)
        break;
    /* Host sends HEADER or FRAME fields described above, obtains body/size. */
    if (hv_client_response(source, body, body_size) < 0)
        goto failed;
}
size_t size = hv_client_reconstruct(source, frame, NULL, 0);
/* Allocate size bytes, reconstruct into them, then pass them to the decoder.
 * The host owns that buffer; the source does not allocate a decoded image. */
/* ... */
hv_client_destroy(source);
return 0;

failed:
/* Report hv_client_error(source), close the host's channel, then destroy. */
hv_client_destroy(source);
return -1;
```

For channel recovery, keep the source. `hv_client_model` writes retained-bin
declarations in bounded batches; start its cursor at zero and stop at an empty
batch. Select no codestreams (`stream` equal to the frame count, `layers=0`).
The first batch opens a replacement channel on the original target; later
batches use its `cid`. Submit these responses with `hv_client_restore_response`,
which checks repeated metadata and requires a normal EOR. Then retry the
original pending request. Restoration retains geometry, quality and metadata
pointers and does not complete the pending frame request. Use it only after a
successful initial metadata exchange, for the same immutable target.

A response ending before window completion retains its bytes without
confirming quality; the host can prepare another request. A rejected response
may have applied valid preceding messages. Its pending
request remains available for retry, but protocol errors require closing the
channel. Destroying the source releases its metadata and cache in the correct
order. The XML returned by `hv_client_xml` remains valid until destruction;
`hv_client_palette` copies into a host buffer. `hv_client_reconstruct` preserves
sample precision and uses the same size-query/caller-buffer convention as
`hv_reconstruct`.

### Requests

One channel per image, one request at a time on it.

```
GET /movie.jpx?cnew=http&type=jpp-stream&stream=3&fsiz=1024,1024,closest
GET /<path>?cid=<cid>&stream=3&fsiz=2048,2048,closest
GET /<path>?cid=<cid>&cclose=<cid>
```

- The first request names the image and asks for a channel. Its response has
  the header `JPIP-cnew`, whose `cid` and `path` fields the later requests
  use.
- `stream` is the frame. `fsiz` is its size at the `reduce` wanted: the full
  size divided by 2^`reduce`, rounded up.
- The first response of a channel also carries the metadata of all frames,
  whatever it asks for.
- A frame's size and resolution levels are known once its main header has
  arrived. Before that, request `stream=<frame>&layers=0`, then use
  `hv_reconstruct_status` to size the pixel request.
- Do not use `len` for pixel requests. For a whole-frame request limited by
  `layers`, apply its entire response and call `hv_reconstruct_confirm` only
  after `WINDOW_DONE` or `IMAGE_DONE`, with its exact reduction and clamped
  layer count. This records the whole-packet prefixes for reconstruction.
  An unconfirmed partial precinct is refused. `layers=0` is
  used only to obtain headers.
- [`../JPIP_PROFILE.md`](../JPIP_PROFILE.md) describes the requests the server
  accepts, and [`../CHANNELS.md`](../CHANNELS.md) its channels, status codes
  and timeouts.

### Low-level calls

| Call | Header | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `hv_cache_begin`, `hv_cache_release` | `hv_cache.h` | The store of one source |
| `hv_jpp_begin`, `hv_jpp_next`, `hv_jpp_reason` | `hv_jpp.h` | The messages of a response body, and why the response ended |
| `hv_cache_apply` | `hv_cache.h` | A message added to the store |
| `hv_cache_model` | `hv_cache.h` | Retained bins declared in bounded batches for a replacement channel |
| `hv_cache_match_metadata` | `hv_cache.h` | Repeated metadata checked against complete retained bins during restoration |
| `hv_reconstruct_confirm` | `hv_reconstruct.h` | Whole-packet prefixes recorded after a completed layer-limited window |
| `hv_metadata_open`, `hv_metadata_close` | `hv_metadata.h` | An index of the metadata; its `count` is the number of frames |
| `hv_metadata_xml` | `hv_metadata.h` | A frame's XML, in place in the store |
| `hv_metadata_palette` | `hv_metadata.h` | A frame's color table, copied out |
| `hv_reconstruct_status` | `hv_reconstruct.h` | A frame's size, components and resolution levels, and how many levels are cached |
| `hv_reconstruct` | `hv_reconstruct.h` | A frame as a JPEG 2000 codestream |
| `hv_image_decode` | `hv_image.h` | A codestream decoded to pixels |

The low-level APIs remain available for programs that need direct message or
data-bin access. Each header documents its calls' results. Calls that take `error` and
`error_size` write a message there when they fail.

### Low-level notes

- **`hv_status`.** `complete` counts cached resolution levels from the lowest,
  so the lowest usable `reduce` is `resolutions - complete`, and 0 means
  nothing can be decoded yet. All fields are 0 until the frame's main header
  has arrived. The first call prepares the geometry and reconstruction
  header; later calls reuse them and look the precinct bins up. It reads no
  packet and decodes nothing.
- **`hv_reconstruct`.** Called with no buffer, it returns the size; called
  with one, it writes. The codestream has empty packets above the cached
  levels or quality layers, so any decoder reads it. For full-quality requests,
  leave out `resolutions - complete` levels. For confirmed previews, use the
  reduction requested. Unknown partial precincts are refused; confirmed
  prefixes stay usable if a later refinement appends unfinished packets.
- **`hv_image_decode`.** `HV_IMAGE_SAMPLES` scales samples to 8 bits.
  `HV_IMAGE_INDICES` keeps them as they are, for a frame with a color table;
  it accepts one unsigned component of at most 8 bits. See [What the pixels
  are](#what-the-pixels-are).
- **`hv_metadata`.** Start with `{0}`. `hv_metadata_open` fails while the
  metadata is incomplete, which it is not after a whole first response. The
  index points into the store: XML pointers stay valid until
  `hv_cache_release`, and the index must be closed before the store is
  released.
- **Color tables.** `HV_PALETTE_MAX` bytes hold any table. A call with
  capacity 0 returns `entries` and sets `channels` without writing.
- **Errors in a response.** When `hv_jpp_next` or `hv_cache_apply` fails, the
  store no longer matches the server's record of the channel. Close the
  channel. What is cached still decodes.
- **Threads.** A store has no locking: use it from one thread at a time.
- **Pixels.** `image.pixels` is allocated with `malloc`; the caller frees it.

`hv_wasm.c` and `js/jpip_channel.mjs` together are such a program, and the
shortest complete example.

## Limits

- **Whole-frame windows only.** No regions or decoding during response
  arrival. Layer-limited previews decode after the window completes; arbitrary
  byte-limited partial delivery is not supported.
- **No eviction.** The cache grows until the source is destroyed.
- **Bounded recovery.** An operation attempts one replacement channel. There
  is no background keepalive or retry loop while a server remains unavailable.
- **This server's files.** The client reads what esajpip sends for the files
  it accepts ([`../JPIP_PROFILE.md`](../JPIP_PROFILE.md)): one tile, no
  component subsampling. The [display API](#what-the-pixels-are) has narrower
  precision, component and color support. It is not a general JPIP client.
- **Lossy images.** Pixels from the WebAssembly module and from a native build
  can differ by 1, as the two round the floating-point wavelet differently.

## hv_jpp2j2k

```
hv_jpp2j2k [-c codestream] -o file.j2k response [response ...]
```

Writes a frame as a `.j2k` file from the response bodies of one channel, in
the order received. With `image.jp2` (4096x4096 here) on the server:

```sh
# The whole image at 1024x1024, on a new channel.
curl -s -D headers.txt -o r1.jpp \
  'http://localhost:8900/image.jp2?cnew=http&type=jpp-stream&stream=0&fsiz=1024,1024,closest'
build/client/hv_jpp2j2k -o frame1024.j2k r1.jpp
opj_decompress -i frame1024.j2k -o frame1024.pgm -r 2

# Then at full size on the same channel: only what is missing is sent.
cid=$(sed -n 's/^JPIP-cnew: cid=\([0-9a-f]*\).*/\1/p' headers.txt)
curl -s -o r2.jpp "http://localhost:8900/jpip?cid=$cid&stream=0&fsiz=4096,4096,closest"
build/client/hv_jpp2j2k -o frame4096.j2k r1.jpp r2.jpp
opj_decompress -i frame4096.j2k -o frame4096.pgm
curl -s "http://localhost:8900/jpip?cid=$cid&cclose=$cid"
```

`-r 2` leaves out the two resolution levels that were not requested. The
decoded pixels equal those of `image.jp2` decoded with the same options.

For a frame of a JPX, `-c` names it:

```sh
curl -s -o f3.jpp \
  'http://localhost:8900/movie.jpx?cnew=http&type=jpp-stream&stream=3&fsiz=1024,1024,closest'
build/client/hv_jpp2j2k -c 3 -o frame3.j2k f3.jpp
```

The tool prints the number of messages of each response and why it ended. It
exits with 0 on success, 1 on an error and 2 on a usage error.

## Tests

```sh
ctest --test-dir build -L client --output-on-failure
```

The tests are in `../tests/client/` and need no network.

| Test | What it checks |
| --- | --- |
| `client_cache` | The store: appending, completion, refusals, many bins, cache-model batching and exact metadata replay |
| `client_jpp` | Messages written by the server's own writer, read back |
| `client_jpp_malformed` | Damaged messages, all refused |
| `client_reconstruct` | Every codestream of the corpus, the transcoder's reference images and the merger's reference movie, served by the server's own code at each resolution: the written codestream, the cached levels, the decoded pixels, and the movie's frame count, XML and color tables |
| `client_image` | Sample scaling at several precisions, and unchanged color table indices |
| `client_source` | The higher-level native API: header requests, per-frame geometry and viewport fit, preview confirmation, refinement, rejected responses, pending-request preservation during restoration, metadata replay and decoded pixel equality |

The JavaScript is checked by a script that needs Node.js, the built module and
a running server:

```sh
node tests/client/check.mjs build/client/web/esajpip_client.wasm \
  http://localhost:8900 movie.jpx
```

It checks argument validation, error types, cache reuse and closing, through
`JpipChannel` and through `JpipSource` with its worker. It decodes the first
frame at every resolution and the others at their lowest, and prints for each
the size, the bytes received, a checksum of the pixels, and the sizes of the
XML and the color table. The checksums are for comparing runs, not checked
against a reference.

Recovery has a separate live check that starts and stops its own server with a
short idle timeout:

```sh
node tests/client/check_recovery.mjs build/client/web/esajpip_client.wasm \
  build/esajpip /path/to/images movie.jpx other-movie.jpx
```

It checks idle expiry, server restart, interrupted response bodies, retained
preview pixels and metadata, refinement against an uninterrupted transfer,
request-line limits, bounded failures, terminal errors, and close during a
pending request. Through `JpipSource` and its worker it also checks failed
module-load retries, concurrent independent movies, expiry, restart and close
during recovery. The second image is optional; omit it to open two independent
sources for the same image. Use images with several resolution levels and
quality layers. A large preview also exercises several cache-model batches.

## How it works

The server delivers a codestream as data-bins: one for the main header, and
one per precinct holding that precinct's packets. The client keeps them in a
hash table (`hv_cache.c`). To decode a frame it writes them back as a
codestream (`hv_reconstruct.c`): the main header, one tile-part, and the
precinct bins in the order of their identifiers, which is resolution,
position, component (RPCL). A precinct with no data gets one empty packet per
layer. No packet is parsed.

The file's boxes arrive as metadata bins (`hv_metadata.c`): bin 0 holds the
top-level boxes, with a placeholder for each codestream and, in a JPX, for
each association box, whose contents are a bin of their own. A color table is
the palette box (`pclr`) that the component mapping (`cmap`) applies, from the
JP2 Header box or, in a JPX, from the frame's own codestream header box
(`jpch`) where that has one.

| File | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `hv_client.c` | Source ownership, response ingestion, frame request planning and automatic quality confirmation, shared by native callers and WASM |
| `hv_jpp.c` | JPP-stream messages (T.808 A.2 and D.3) |
| `hv_cache.c` | One source's data-bins, retained across channel replacement |
| `hv_frame.c` | Geometry and reconstruction header prepared once per frame, owned by its main-header bin |
| `hv_reconstruct.c` | One codestream of the store as a JPEG 2000 codestream; its cached resolution levels |
| `hv_metadata.c` | Frame count, XML and color tables, from the metadata bins |
| `hv_image.c` | Decoding to 8-bit pixels, with OpenJPEG |
| `hv_jpp2j2k.c` | The command-line tool |
| `hv_wasm.c` | The WebAssembly module's entry points |
| `js/jpip_source.mjs` | `JpipSource` |
| `js/jpip_worker.mjs` | The Web Worker of a source |
| `js/jpip_channel.mjs` | `JpipChannel`: the HTTP exchange around the module |
| `demo/index.html` | The demonstration page |
| [`vendor/openjpeg/`](vendor/openjpeg/README.md) | OpenJPEG 2.5.4 |
