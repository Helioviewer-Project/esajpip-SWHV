/* hv_reconstruct.h: one codestream of a store, written as a JPEG 2000
 * codestream a decoder reads.
 *
 * The server delivers a codestream as data-bins: its main header, and for
 * each precinct one bin holding that precinct's packets, layer after layer.
 * This writes them as a codestream again: the main header, one tile-part,
 * and the precinct bins in resolution, position, component order. That is
 * the order of the bin identifiers and the RPCL progression, so the COD is
 * rewritten to RPCL and no packet is parsed. A precinct the client holds
 * nothing of gets one empty packet per layer; a decoder then reads the
 * image up to the resolution that was requested.
 *
 * For codestreams of the served profile (JPIP_PROFILE.md): one tile, zero
 * origins, unit sampling, no COC or POC. Every precinct bin held must be
 * complete or have whole packets confirmed by hv_reconstruct_confirm.
 * Unknown partial precincts are refused. */
