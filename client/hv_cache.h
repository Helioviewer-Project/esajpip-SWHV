/* hv_cache.h: the client's store of delivered data-bins.
 *
 * One source owns one store. Each data-bin is identified by its class,
 * codestream and Bin-ID, and arrives in messages that must append without a gap,
 * because the server tracks exactly the same prefixes: if the client and server
 * disagree about a bin's length, every later request is wrong. The store
 * therefore refuses any message that does not continue a bin where it left off,
 * rather than trying to reconcile the difference.
 *
 * A bin is complete once a message sets the last-byte flag. Bins stay in
 * memory for the life of the source, complete or not: the server will not
 * resend what it has sent, and it takes no notice that a client has dropped
 * something (JPIP_PROFILE.md: no subtractive cache model).
 * A replacement channel for the same immutable target can be synchronized
 * with hv_cache_model without discarding the store.
 *
 * The store is a hash table on a bin's identity, so it holds the many
 * codestreams of a movie; memory is its only limit.
