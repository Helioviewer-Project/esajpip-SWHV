/* hv_rules.h: the cross-field rules of the model (listed at the end of
 * ../spec/j2k-headers.asn1, ../spec/j2k-codestream.asn1 and
 * ../spec/jp2-boxes.asn1): marker segment bodies, tile-part indices, PLT
 * entries and packet counts, the segments of a codestream across its
 * headers, the box tree, JPX boxes and JP2 header boxes. They are written
 * once, here, and used both by the reader (hv_reader.c) and by the model's
 * harness (../spec/harness/crossfield_impl.h, crossfield.c), which labels
 * the corpus in ../tests/vectors/j2k; some take values the caller decoded,
 * some (the box tree, the fragments) the file's bytes. The rules on the
 * placement and count of segments and on the file's first boxes the reader
 * and the harness each check in their own code, the reader on the bytes and
 * the harness on the decoded model, under the same names. With HV_PROFILE
 * the reader applies
 * every JP2 rule the profile labels come from; its T.800 mode leaves some
 * out (see README.md, "What the reader checks").
 *
 * `profile` selects the layer of a function that checks rules of both: 0
 * for the standard (T.800, T.801), nonzero for the served profile
 * (JPIP_PROFILE.md), which adds the server's restrictions. A function
 * whose rules all belong to the profile (hv_rule_tile_part_count,
 * hv_rule_url, hv_rule_flst) or all to the standard (the header box rules)
 * takes no `profile`: the caller calls it only at that layer.
 *
 * Each check returns NULL when the rules hold, otherwise the name of the
 * rule that fails (hv_rule_box_tree: at the top level, a box that is not
 * framed, in hv_boxes_next's words); the checks do not allocate. The
 * corpus manifest uses the same names, for the rules a vector exercises;
 * some (file.size-limit, ...) no vector does. The box iterator, the File
 * Type box's reader, hv_rule_tiles and hv_rule_packets are not checks but
 * what the checks and the reader work from. */
