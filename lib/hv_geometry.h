/* hv_geometry.h: the resolutions, bands, precincts and code-blocks of one
 * tile, and its packets in progression order, from the decoded SIZ and COD
 * (T.800 B.2 to B.7 and B.12).
 *
 * The partition is computed, not stored: precincts and code-blocks are
 * counted per resolution and band, and the code-blocks of one precinct are
 * derived when asked for. Code-blocks are numbered per band in raster order
 * of the band's code-block grid, bands in (component, resolution, band)
 * order. Two precinct partitions of a tile that keep its code-block
 * partition therefore give every code-block the same number.
 *
 * One COD applies to every component (no COC), and the progression has no
 * POC. Counts saturate at 2^64 - 1.
 *
 * A header can declare far more than its data holds, so the caller states
 * how much it lays out (hv_geometry_limits), and hv_geometry_init checks
 * the SIZ and COD it is given before it uses them. */
