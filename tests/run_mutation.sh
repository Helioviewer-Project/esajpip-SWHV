#!/bin/sh
# Mutation testing: one-operator mutants of the files named (tests/mutate.py),
# each built and run against the tests. A mutant the tests pass survives: a
# change of behaviour that no test notices.
#
#   tests/run_mutation.sh [FILE...]     default: lib/hv_rules.c lib/hv_reader.c
#
# FILE is relative to the repository. The sources are copied to WORK/src,
# which is built in WORK/build, so the checkout is never modified. Each
# mutant is written into the copy, built (incrementally), run, and the file
# put back. Listing, applying and restoring all use WORK/original, saved
# from that same copy; editing the checkout cannot change the mutant IDs.
# Before the first mutant the unmutated copy must pass.
#
# Environment:
#   ESAJPIP_TEST_BUILD_DIR      WORK (default build/mutation)
#   ESAJPIP_MUTATION_OPERATORS  mutate.py operators (default
#                               rule,relational,logical,negation)
#   ESAJPIP_MUTATION_LINES      FIRST-LAST: only the mutants on those lines
#   ESAJPIP_MUTATION_EVERY      N: every Nth mutant only (default 1)
#   ESAJPIP_MUTATION_TESTS      the CTest selection (default "-L tools")
#   ESAJPIP_MUTATION_TIMEOUT    seconds per test (default 120)
#   ESAJPIP_JOBS, ESAJPIP_CTEST_JOBS, as for the other runners
#
# WORK/report.tsv has a line per mutant: file, mutant, line, operator,
# change, and killed, survived, timeout (a test ran out of time) or build
# (it does not compile). WORK/survivors.txt lists the survivors.
