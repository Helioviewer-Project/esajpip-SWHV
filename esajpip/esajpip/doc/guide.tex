\section{Introduction}
\label{introduction}

The ESA JPIP server is capable to handle the following types of JPEG2000 image files:
raw J2C, JP2 and JPX with or without hyperlinks. The codestreams of the images
must comply with the following requirements:

\begin{itemize}
\item No tiles partition is allowed.
\item The progression order must be LRCP, RLCP or RPCL.
\item PLT markers must be included with the information of all the packets.
\end{itemize}

If one image does not fit these requirements then it can not be served by this
server. Moreover, although they are not mandatory, the following requirements
are strongly recommended:

\begin{itemize}
\item No tile-parts.
\item Use the RPCL progression order.
\item Use an appropriate precinct partition.
\end{itemize}

The ESA JPIP server does not transcode the images at all, serving them as it. 
Therefore the last requirement is particularly recommended for big images in
order to improve the transmission efficiency. For resolution levels bigger 
than $1024 \times 1024$ precincts of $512 \times 512$ or $256 \times 256$ are
recommended.

\section{Installation}

In order to install the server it is necessary to get the code (for example,
from \href{https://code.launchpad.net/esajpip}{Launchpad}) and compile it.
The code of the server has been specifically written for Linux systems, so it
has not been tested in any other platform.

For compiling the source code the libraries libproc, log4cpp and libconfig++
must be installed, for developing, on the system (see Section \ref{libraries} 
for more details about these used libraries). 

Just by means of one ``make'' the compilation is performed. If ``make doc'' is
used, this documentation is created automatically mixing this text with the
source code documentation (\href{http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/}{Doxygen} 
and LaTeX are required to be installed).

In order to get running the application it is only necessary to modify the
configuration file as needed (see Section \ref{config}) and to have a caching
directory with the write permission enabled for the server.

\section{Configuration}
\label{config}

The configuration of the different parameters of the server is carried out by
means of the file ``server.cfg'', which must be located in the same directory
where the server is launched. The structure of this file is:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Section ``\textit{listen\_at}'':
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Field ``\textit{port}'': Port used for listening.
			\item Field ``\textit{address}'': IP server address used for listening. This
field can be empty meaning that the server will listen at any address available.
		\end{itemize}

	\item Section ``\textit{folders}'':
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Field ``\textit{images}'': Root of the folder where the images to serve
are stored.
			\item	Field ``\textit{caching}'': Root of the folder to store the cache files.
			\item	Field ``\textit{logging}'': Folder to store the log files.
		\end{itemize}
	\item Section ``\textit{connections}'':
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Field ``\textit{time\_out}'': It defines the timeout (in seconds) of every connection.
			\item	Field ``\textit{max\_number}'': The maximum number of simultaneous connections.
		\end{itemize}
	\item Section ``\textit{general}'':
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Field ``\textit{logging}'': It indicates if the log file is created (1 - Yes, 0 - No).
			\item	Field ``\textit{cache\_max\_time}'': Expiration time of the cache files, in seconds. If
this value is less than zero it means that no expiration time is used for the cache files.
			\item	Field ``\textit{max\_chunk\_size}'': Maximum chunk size used for transmission, in bytes.
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Each time the server opens an image to be served, it creates a little associated cache file,
if it does not exist yet, with the related indexing information, within the configured
caching folder.

Here is an example of a configuration file, which is the default one
included in the Launchpad repository:

\lstinputlisting[numbers=none,xleftmargin=50pt]{../../server.cfg}


\section{Commands}
\label{commands}

The application accepts the following command line parameters:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{esa\_jpip\_server [start]}: It runs the server application.
	\item \textit{esa\_jpip\_server status}: It shows some information (memory, num. of connections, etc.) of the current server process.
		Currently the information shown is:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The available total memory.
			\item	The memory consumed by the father process.
			\item	The memory consumed by the child process.
			\item	The number of connections.
			\item	The number of iterations (the number of times that the child process has been restarted).
			\item	The number of threads of the child process.
			\item	The CPU usage of the child process.
		\end{itemize}
	\item \textit{esa\_jpip\_server record [name\_file]}: It shows the same information in columns, being updated every 5 seconds. It accepts a third parameter, a name of a file where to store this information.
	\item \textit{esa\_jpip\_server stop [child]}: Both processes or only the child process (depending on the second parameter) associated to the current server running are finished. 
	\item \textit{esa\_jpip\_server debug [child]}: It calls the debugger for the parent or child process depending on the second parameter.
 	\item \textit{esa\_jpip\_server clean cache}: It removes all the cache files from the cache root folder which have exceeded the ``cache\_max\_time'' field from the ``server.cfg'' file.
It also removes the existing ``.backup'' files from the same directory.
\end{itemize}


\chapter{Developer guide}

\section{Introduction}

The idea for the development of this application has been to implement a very
stable and scalable solution of a JPIP server, specifically designed for Linux
systems in order to fully profit from its characteristics. No portability
strategies has been followed.

The language chosen for the development is C++, writing the code following  as
much as possible the
\href{http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml}{Google
style guide}. The code is commented according to the Javadoc format, what
allows to use the Doxygen tool and generate the documentation of the
Part \ref{sourcecode} automatically. This documentation includes, if the tool
\href{http://www.graphviz.org/}{Graphviz} is installed, the collaboration diagrams 
of all the classes, as well as the call diagrams of all the functions are 
generated.

No libraries strictly related to the server performance have been used, except
from the \href{http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/}{standard STL library} and 
\href{https://computing.llnl.gov/tutorials/pthreads/}{pthread}. 
The used libraries (see Section \ref{libraries}) are only related to secondary 
features of the application. 

For the data/file
operations the classes of the namespace \hyperlink{namespacedata}{data} 
are implemented. For example, 
the class \hyperlink{classdata_1_1BaseFile}{data::BaseFile} is a 
safe wrapper for the
FILE related functions; the classes \hyperlink{classdata_1_1InputStream}
{data::InputStream} and \hyperlink{classdata_1_1OutputStream}
{data::OutputStream} allow the binary serialization of the classes;
etc. 

Regarding the IPC and threads management operations the classes of the
namespace \hyperlink{namespaceipc}{ipc} have been designed. For example,
the class \hyperlink{classipc_1_1Mutex}{ipc::Mutex} implements the
logic of a mutex; the class \hyperlink{classipc_1_1RdWrLock}
{ipc::RdWrLock} implements a reader/writer lock based on the 
pthread\_rwlock functions; etc.

Working with socket has been easy thanks to the classes of the namespace
\hyperlink{namespacenet}{net}. For example, the class 
\hyperlink{classnet_1_1Socket}{net::Socket} offers a powerful interface
for the socket Linux functions; the class \hyperlink{classnet_1_1SocketStream}
{net::SocketStream} allows working with sockets as continuous data streams,
compatible with the stream classes defined in the STL library; etc.

Finally, for working with the HTTP protocol the classes of the namespace
\hyperlink{namespacehttp}{http} have been implemented. Among others, the
classes \hyperlink{classhttp_1_1Request}{http::Request} and 
\hyperlink{classhttp_1_1Response}{http::Response} permit to generate/generate
HTTP messages, being compatible with the STL streams.

With the help of the library \href{http://log4cpp.sourceforge.net/}{log4cpp}
a trace system has been designed in order to easy the server logging as well
as the debugging. The macros ``LOG'' and ``ERROR'' are defined to log
information and error messages respectively, whilst the macro ``TRACE'' is
defined to put debugging information in any part of the code. The debugging
logs can be enabled/disabled by means of the macro ``SHOW\_TRACES''. For
information see the content of the file \hyperlink{trace_8h}{trace.h}.

Before explaining in detail the server architecture in Section \ref{sec:architecture},
some concepts of the JPEG2000 standard (Section \ref{sec:jpeg2000}), as well as
the JPIP protocol (Section \ref{sec:jpip}) are explained, necessary to
correctly understand the server code.

The classes of the server code related to the JPEG2000 standard are defined in
the namespace \hyperlink{namespacejpeg2000}{jpeg2000}. The classes for working
with the JPIP protocol are located within the namespace \hyperlink{namespacejpip}
{jpip}. Within the text of the following sections, references to some classes
of these namespaces are given.

\section{Server architecture}
\label{sec:architecture}

\begin{figure}[!b]

\input{../architecture}
}
\caption{Server architecture.}
\label{fig:server}
\end{figure}

Fig. \ref{fig:server} shows a basic representation of the server architecture. It
consists of a hybrid model combining both process and thread approaches.

There are two processes, herein after called father and child. The first one
creates the second one and is who listens for new client connections. When
a new client connection is accepted by the father process, it sends this
connection to the child process through a UNIX-domain socket in order
to be attended. The child process is who provides all the functionality
to handle the client connections. Each client connection is handled
in the child process by a dedicated thread.

The father process maintains a vector with all the open connections. When
a connection is closed by the client, the child process notifies to the
father process, through the UNIX-domain socket, in order to remove the 
connection from the vector. 

Since the father does not perform relevant operations, its probability of
crashing due to an error is low. On the contrary, taking into account
that the child process is how maintains all the image indexes and attends
all the client connections, it may fail due to errors or not yet fixed
bugs. When a process is crashed, all the related threads and connections
are automatically closed. In the case of the child process, the current
open connections are not closed because they are shared with the father
process. This last can detect when the child process is down and launch
a new child process. This new process, considering that it inherits the
connections vector of the father process, it is capable to reestablish the
connections without affecting the clients, that is, the clients do not
notice when the child process crashes. 

This architecture provides a 
fault-tolerant and robust approach for the server, as well as it 
offers a good performance. The multi-threading solution
implemented in the child process is efficient in terms of memory 
consumption and fast sharing/locking mechanisms. Having separated
the client handling code from the father process provides 
robustness and security. In the source code of the main module
\hyperlink{esa__jpip__server_8cc}{esa\_jpip\_server.cc} can be
seen how this server architecture is created.

The configuration of the server is read from the file ``server.cfg''
(see Section \ref{config} for details). This configuration is parsed
by the class \hyperlink{classAppConfig}{AppConfig} and shared with both
the father and child process.

Between the father and child process is maintained a shared memory
block, carried out by the class \hyperlink{classAppInfo}{AppInfo}. This
allows to share information between the two processes, as well as to
provide a mechanism for getting information from other processes, like
in the case of the commands ``record'' and ``status'' (see Section
\ref{commands}).
 
The main parts of the child process, shown in Fig. \ref{fig:server}, are
the File manager, the Index manager and the Client manager, that
are explained in the following subsections.

Every client connection is handled by a Client manager module, in an
independent thread. This module manages the communication with the
client, serving as the JPIP interface with the sub-module Data-bin server. 
This sub-module contains the code to properly generate the data-bins
associated to the client requests, implementing as well the client
cache model.

The Index manager module is the responsible to manage the image indexes stored
in memory. When client requests to open a certain JPEG2000 image, the related
Client manager module requests the Index module for the associated 
indexing information. This module manages the indexing information in memory
of all the currently open images by all the Client manager modules.

The File manager module is in charge of parsing and extracting the indexing
information of the image files that are requested by the Index manager module.
The indexing information of each image is cached by means of little binary
``.cache'' files in order to avoid to repeat the indexing process when the
same image is open several times. These cache files are stored in the directory
specified in the configuration file.

\subsection{File manager}

The code of this module is contained in the class 
\hyperlink{classjpeg2000_1_1FileManager}{jpeg2000::FileManager}. Its main
function is to extract the indexing information of the image files.

The supported format files are J2C, JP2 and JPX, with or without 
hyperlinks. The files must also comply with the limitations specified 
in Section \ref{introduction}.

The indexing information of an image file is stored in an
instance of the class \hyperlink{classjpeg2000_1_1ImageInfo}
{jpeg2000::ImageInfo}. It
contains mainly a set of \hyperlink{classdata_1_1FileSegment}
{data::FileSegment} objects (pair of offset and length information
about a file segment) regarding the main headers, PLT segments,
metadata segments, etc., of the image.

The class \hyperlink{classjpeg2000_1_1ImageInfo}
{jpeg2000::ImageInfo} as well as all of its members variables
can be serialized using the serialization classes defined in
the namespace \hyperlink{namespacedata}{data}. This makes
easy load/save indexing information from the ``.cache'' files.

When the Index manager requests to the File manager the
indexing information of an image file, this last firstly checks
whether the associated ``.cache'' file exists or not. If it
exists, it just reads it, using the serialization to an 
\hyperlink{classjpeg2000_1_1ImageInfo}{jpeg2000::ImageInfo} object
and returns it. If there is not any cache file yet, it opens
the image file and parses it, generating the corresponding
cache file.

The cache files are stored in the directory defined in the configuration
file, and they are named using the full path of the image
files, replacing each directory separator '/' by underscores '\_',
and adding the extension ``.cache''. 

The server does not remove any cache file during its execution. They
can be removed either manually or by means of the server command
``clean cache'' using a LRU policy specified in the server configuration
file (see Section \ref{commands}).

\subsection{Index manager}

The code of this module is contained in the class 
\hyperlink{classjpeg2000_1_1IndexManager}{jpeg2000::IndexManager}. Its main
function is to manage the indexes of all the image files opened by the
server.

The index of each image is built from the indexing information retrieved
from the file manager module. Notice that the indexing information
generated by the file manager does not deal with packets, just the main
parts of the image, like the position of the main header or the
position of the PLT markers. From this initial information, the index
manager builds a complete index of all the packets of each image.

Each opened image is represented by an object of the class
\hyperlink{classjpeg2000_1_1ImageIndex}{jpeg2000::ImageIndex}. All
of these objects are handled by the index manager using a double linked
list in memory. 

When a J2C, JP2 or JPX (without hyperlinks) image file is opened, a
new \hyperlink{classjpeg2000_1_1ImageIndex}{jpeg2000::ImageIndex} is created,
if it does not already exist, and inserted in the list. When a JPX
image file with hyperlinks is opened, the index manager handles each
contained hyperlink independently. In this case a new node is also
created in the list, but it contains references to all the nodes
associated to its hyperlinks. Some of them may already exist in the list,
or they have been created.

Each image node in the list contains a reference count When this
count value gets zero, the node is removed from the list. The number
of references is incremented each time a client manager requests
for the associated image file, or when a JPX file is opened that
contains a link to that image file. 

When a client manager opens a new channel, it requests to the index 
manager for the index of the image associated to this new channel.
The index manager returns a reference of an object of the class
\hyperlink{classjpeg2000_1_1ImageIndex}{jpeg2000::ImageIndex}. 

The packet index (handled by means of the class 
\hyperlink{classjpeg2000_1_1PacketIndex}{jpeg2000::PacketIndex}) of
each image file is created on demand, by resolution level. In order
to support this feature, the image file must be compressed
with the progression order RPCL. On the contrary, the packet index
is fully created at the beginning, when the image file is opened.
This way of creating the index allows to adjust the memory
consumption required for the indexes according to the user
movements through the image.

The modifications (inserting or removing nodes) of the list of indexes 
are controlled by a mutex lock. However, each index node contains its
own independent locking mechanism for the modifications of the packet
index. Multiple threads, associated each one to a client manager,
can be working with the same image index node. If the packet index
does not allow to be generated on demand, the main operation of
all the threads over the packet index is to read. When the RPCL
progression is used and the packet index can be built on demand,
any thread can modify it (e.g. accessing to a new resolution
level). A reader/writer lock mechanism has been chosen for controlling
the modifications/accesses of the packet indexes, giving priority to
the read operations (the most common ones) over the write operations.

The class \hyperlink{classjpeg2000_1_1PacketIndex}{jpeg2000::PacketIndex}
uses internally the class \hyperlink{classdata_1_1vint__vector}
{data::vint\_vector} to stores the information of each packet. This
class allows to use vectors of integers where each integer value can
occupy a number of bytes not necessarily multiple of $2$. For example,
if an image contains less than $2^{24}$ packets, each packet can
be represented in the index by just $3$ bytes, instead of the minimal
standard $4$ bytes. 

The information stored of each packet in the index vector 
is only the associated file offset. If the image file contains several tile-parts, 
not recommended, thus dividing the set of packets in not contiguous segments, 
special markers are included to identify the offset jumps.


\subsection{Client manager}

The class \hyperlink{classClientManager}{ClientManager} contains the required
code to handle a client connection. When a new client connection is established
by the server, a new instance of this class is created passing a reference
to the application shared information (\hyperlink{classAppInfo}{AppInfo}), a
reference of the server configuration information (\hyperlink{classAppConfig}
{AppConfig}) and a reference to the Index manager (\hyperlink{classjpeg2000_1_1IndexManager}
{jpeg2000::IndexManager}). A new
thread is created for this connection which calls the method ``Run''
of the class.

The function of the code of the class \hyperlink{classClientManager}{ClientManager} 
is basically to parse the client requests (with the help of the class
\hyperlink{classjpip_1_1Request}{jpip::Request}) and form the appropriate responses,
all of them according to the JPIP protocol in HTTP format. It implements a basic
channel handling mechanism, as well as the interface with the Index manager, in
order to, when a new image file is requested by the client, get the associated
index.

Although the standard allows to use several channels over the same connection,
this implementation does not allow this feature. In practice, the most of the
applications do not use more than just one channel per connection, like for example
in the case of the viewer kdu\_show, from the Kakadu library, or JHelioviewer. This
means that the JPIP concepts of channel and session refer in this implementation
to the same thing. However, in the same connection, the client can open and
close several channels as many times as required, but considering that only
one channel can be opened at the same time.

In order to identify the channel opened by the client, a simple integer number
is used, which is incremented each time the client opens and closes a channel.
The target identifier returned by the server, when a channel is opened, and 
that is commonly used by the JPIP clients to perform local caching, is the
full path of the associated image file. This avoids the coherence problems
detected in other server implementations (like in the case of the kdu\_server)
when using complex hash values.

Taking into account that the child process can be restarted, and the client
manager might be started over an existing client connection, a mechanism to
find out the data already sent to the client, but without requesting it,
has been implemented. Each time all the complete data of a WOI has been
sent to the client, a little ``.backup'' file is created in the caching
directory with the content of the client cache model. Therefore, when
a client manager is started, it checks whether an associated ``.backup''
exists or not, loading its information as the current content of the
client cache model if so.

The main flow chart of the code of the client manager module can be observed in
Fig. \ref{fig:client_manager}. In the processing step of generating a new
chunk of data is when the data-bin server module is called. 

\begin{figure}
\centering
\resizebox{0.9\textwidth}{!}{
\input{../client_manager}
}
\caption{Flow chart of the client manager.}
\label{fig:client_manager}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Data-bin server}

The code of this module is located at the class \hyperlink{classjpip_1_1DataBinServer}
{jpip::DataBinServer}. This module manages the data that is served to a client, having
methods to generate chunks and data-bins, as well as it maintains the client cache
model.

The client cache model is managed with the help of the class 
\hyperlink{classjpip_1_1CacheModel}{jpip::CacheModel}. This class can be serialized,
what make easy saving/loading the ``.backup'' files generated by the client manager.

The data-bin server module uses the methods of the class 
\hyperlink{classjpip_1_1DataBinWriter}{jpip::DataBinWriter} for generating the
data-bins that will be sent to the client by the client manager.

Once the client manager receives a WOI request from the client, it is passed to
the data-bin server, which parses it and prepares the related resources for
the data-bin generation. For
instance, when the WOI specifies a set of hyperlinked layers within a JPX file, 
the data-bin server opens the associated files putting them ready for
extracting packets. An object of the class \hyperlink{classjpip_1_1WOIComposer}
{WOIComposer} is also prepared to explore the packets associated to the
WOI specified in the client request.

For each WOI request the client manager sends JPIP responses encapsulated in
HTTP messages, and using the chunked transfer encoding. The maximum length
of each chunk is determined by the value specified within the configuration
file. The method  ``GenerateChunk'' of the class \hyperlink{classjpip_1_1DataBinServer}
{jpip::DataBinServer} is able to fill a memory buffer, usually related to
a chunk data, with data-bins, according to the current client cache model and
the last passed request. This is the method used by the client manager to
generate the responses.

The data-bin server generates a new chunk of data-bins considering the data
already sent, recorded in the client cache model. Therefore, if the first
$N$ bytes of a precinct data-bin has been already sent to the client, in
the next chunk generation, these first $N$ bytes of the same precinct are
not included.

The sequence of data-bins that are included when a new data chunk is generated,
calling the ``GenerateChunk'' method, is as follows:

\begin{enumerate}

\item All the metadatas

\item For each codestream:
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Main-header
	\item Tile-header
	\end{enumerate}

\item For each packet given by the \hyperlink{classjpip_1_1WOIComposer}{WOIComposer}:
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item For each codestream: Precinct
	\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}

Notice that, as it has been commented, the chunk generation and data-bin
inclusion is incremental according to the client cache model and the previous
sequence. For example, if
the metadata of an image file occupies $1$ MByte, and the chunk size is $1$ KB,
more than $1000$ chunks would be required to be generated before being able to
generate the first chunk with packet data (precinct). 

\section{Libraries}
\label{libraries}

The application uses the following libraries:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{Libconfig++}: The libconfig++ library (\href{http://www.hyperrealm.com/libconfig/}{http://www.hyperrealm.com/libconfig/}) is used to read the
information of the configuration file of the server. The configuration 
file accepts C-like comments.
	\item \textit{Libproc}: The general information about the server process is shown thanks to this library (\href{http://packages.debian.org/sid/libproc-dev/}{http://packages.debian.org/sid/libproc-dev/}).
	\item \textit{Log4cpp}: This library is in charge of flexible logging to file (\href{http://log4cpp.sourceforge.net/}{http://log4cpp.sourceforge.net/}).
\end{itemize}
