/* hv_rewrite.h: writes a file again with hv_writer from what hv_reader
 * decodes, to check the writer against real files (hv_walk -w,
 * test/test_rewrite.c, ../spec/harness/writers.c).
 *
 * Every box is written with hv_begin_box and hv_end_box (XLBox where the
 * input has it), superboxes by their children, a codestream box by its
 * items: SIZ, COD, QCD, COM and PLT (hv_write_plt_segment, split as in
 * the input) from their decoded form, SOT with a measured Psot, other
 * segments from their body. The JPX boxes the writer
 * has functions for are written by them when the input is in their form
 * (a short box header, and no bytes the function could not write): ftyp,
 * flst with one fragment, url, a dtbl's NDR, rreq, and the entries of a
 * cmap. Everything else is copied.
 *
 * A file in the writer's form comes out byte for byte. Where the writer
 * writes the same content in its own form, the result says why the bytes
 * differ (uncomparable): LBox = 0 or Psot = 0 (written as lengths), zero
 * PLT entries (dropped), and PLT entries in more bytes than their values
 * need (written in the fewest). A tile-part header whose PLT segments are
 * not in the order of their Zplt (T.800 A.7.3 allows any) is refused: the
 * writer writes them in segment order, Zplt 0, 1, 2, ... */
